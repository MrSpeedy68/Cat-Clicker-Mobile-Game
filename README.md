### Store
In Cat Clicker milk bottles are featured as a rare resource that is an alternative buying currency that can purchase additional cats or upgrades. If you ever run out it's not a problem as you can purchase more in the store or watch an ad to get additional milk bottles so you don't have to wait for them to randomly drop during gameplay and save you time.
